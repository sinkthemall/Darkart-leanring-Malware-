# List of blogs, posts, documentations I found while learning malware
Most of malware techniques I learn are from blogs, posts and through some documents I found in internet. Those I list above some of them are technique to create virus, some of them are just base knowledge. Feel free to learn it (My school is such a shitty place, they don't even bother to teach technique properly, therefore there aren't many helpful document from lectures that are good)
