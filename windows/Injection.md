### LIST OF INJECTION TECHNIQUES
Injection in here meaning adding malicious code to the process and execute it.

#### 1. Process injection
In my opinion, this technique should be named : "Shellcode injection", because it is - malloc a memory with read write execute permission and copy shellcode into it, then execute. Dont let the name making confuse.
#### 2. DLL injection
Every process's main flow is started from WinMain, and in case of DLL, there is same start function name DLLMain. When a DLL is load into process, it will execute the DLLMain. So, the main point of this technique is to make a DLL contain malicios code, try to find a way loading it into process memory (LoadLibrary).
#### 3. Process Hollowing
When a process is create with CREATE_SUSPENDED flags, it wont load the process into memory, you can use this to write the process memory into the shellcode instead, and then continue the process. This way, you can avoid being spotted suspicious action, prevent the original malware to be deleted.
