### Why do we need to add new section ?


### How exactly can a new section be added to PE file ?
To answer this, we must ask ourself about affects when new section is added:
-   Does adding change the file size -> leading to data, code raw_offset change?
-   Is Window loader accept self-define section, or just sections like .text, .data, .bss, ...?

About question number 1, the answer is Yes, but it's not like inserting. If you use CFF to analyze headers, you probably notice in the ``OptionalHeader``, there is a field callled ``SizeOfHeaders``. It defines the exact size (in image file, not in memory) of header section, which means, from offset 0 to offset ``SizeOfHeaders`` is the Header Zone. In most case, this zone probably is empty at the end, so it does have space for us to add some section headers define our new section.
