This repo play as a diary, document, noting everything I learn about malware. This repo is for education only. I will not be reponsible for any consequences caused by misuse of documents in this repo.
### Roadmap
Here is the list of targets you should know when learning malware
-   Shellcode (both in windows and linux)
-   Code injection
